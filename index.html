From the source of all my knowledge &mdash; Wikipedia:

In computer science, functional programming is
a programming paradigm, a style of building
the structure and elements of computer programs,
that treats computation as the evaluation of
mathematical functions and avoids changing state and
mutable data.

# Finagle
.left-column[
  ## Pure
]
.right-column[
Your server is a function:
```{.scala}
(Request => Future[Response])
```
Which might have a filter:
```{.scala}
((Request, Service[Request, Response]) => Future[Response])
```
Read "Your Server as a Function" paper for reasoning.

Why so awesome?

```{.scala}
test("delete profile") {
  val service = mock[Service]
  service.deleteProfile(123456789) returns Future()
  val resource = new ProfileResource(service)

  val request = Request(DELETE, "/?c=123456789&s=123")

  val response = Response(Await.result(resource(request)))

  response.status should equal (OK)
  verify(service).deleteProfile(123456789)
}
```

# Non-blocking at all
.left-column[
  ## Async
]
.right-column[
All internals must be asynchronous:

```{.scala}
for {
  defaultProducts <- getDefaultProducts(t)
  recommendations <- getRecommendationsOrDefault(t, p, defaultProducts, count)
  metadata <- getMetadata(t, recommendations.take(pageSize))
} yield new EshopRecommendedProducts(recommendations, metadata)

```
Imagine this code in Java, C# or even F# ;)
]
---
# Non-blocking at all
.left-column[
  ## Async
  ## Not async
]
.right-column[

But not all drivers a non-blocking. We have Redis, remember? ;)

- Redis is multiplexing, like Node.js

- Most drivers are blocking

- Even the best ones, like Jedis

Glueing up async thing is easy. But mixing async and sync code is a nightmare.

Twitter Futures

```{.scala}
def apply[T](f: => T): Future[T]
```
- Are pure (not poluted by execution context)

- Signature is very promising

- But easy to missuse

Twitter's Future pool saves the day:
```{.scala}
val futurePool: ExecutorServiceFuturePool =
  FuturePool.unboundedPool
val result: Future[Long] =
  futurePool(jedisPool.getResource.scard("key"))
```

# ScalaCheck

# ScalaCheck

No! It is not _just_ difficult. Sometimes it:

  - makes you hopeless

  - and depressed

We have already rewritten our ScalaCheck tests for 3 times because of a very high entry level.

We use it as a server side for XML upload

- Huge files (gigabytes, potentialy unlimited)

- Chunked upload

  - Process data while it is being uploaded

Current situation:

- But almost all of them are blocking:

  - You subscribe to events (which seems to be asynchronous behaviour)

  - _But_, source of data is blocking: InputStream, File, ... &mdash; current thread blocks if no data available.

- The second issue: we cannot say "Stop" to incomming data.

# Spray.io
.left-column[
  ## Upload
  ## Chunks
  ## Pull parse
  ## Aalto
]
.right-column[
Aalto parser (half a year ago) was the only stax parser in jvm world which can be used in non-blocking xml parsing.

Asynchronousness is achieved by:

- Method _feedInput_ providing an array of newly available data

- Parse event EVENT_INCOMPLETE, signaling that it is not enough data for parser at the moment

---
# Spray.io
.left-column[
  ## Upload
  ## Chunks

  ## Too stateful
]
.right-column[

Parser can be:
- Not yet parsing

- Parsing (consuming pull events)

- Failed (illegal xml)

- Waiting for input

- Everything is parsed

Data (chunks):

- Arriving

- Temporary stopped

- Permanently stopped

]

# Akka
.left-column[
  ## Rule
]
.right-column[

Rule of thumb:

- If you have a lot of states &mdash; use actor model.

- If app is not too stateful &mdash; you do not need actors

]
---
# Akka
.left-column[
  ## Rule
  ## Advise
]
.right-column[

Akka does not eliminate states, it just makes it easier to handle

- Use Finite State Machine

- Or become/unbecome

]
---
# Akka
.left-column[
  ## Rule
  ## Advise
  ## Transitions
]
.right-column[

If you are waiting for chunk, and:

- Get new chunk, then collect it

- Get a flag of last chunk, then go to finite state

- Get a flag that a parser needs more data, then go to starvation state

```{.scala}
private def receivingChunksState(): Receive = {
  case m: MessageChunk =>
    bytes = bytes ++ m.data.toByteString
  case ChunkedMessageEnd =>
    context.become(noMoreChunks)
  case MoreDataNeeded =>
    if (bytes.nonEmpty) feedAll()
    else context.become(starving, discardOld = false)
}
```

.right-column[
If you are in starvation state, and:

- Get new chunk, then send it to parser and get back to previous state

- Get a flag of last chunk, then signal a parser and got to finite state

```{.scala}
private def starvingState(): Receive = {
  case m: MessageChunk =>
    parser ! FeedData(m.data.toByteString)
    context.unbecome()
  case ChunkedMessageEnd =>
    parser ! NoMoreDataAvailable
    context.become(finalizing)
}
```

Last optimizations _really_ helped:

- Direct call to Cassandra nodes

- Raw data instead of json to save traffic

- Redis persistence on slave

- Calculate hashes: do not write if you can

- Heavy calculations (i.e. set diffs) on slaves

- ... all major optimizations are not language related.

No. We also have (in our team):
